"====Searching=================

" This setting makes search case-insensitive when all characters in the string
" being searched are lowercase. However, the search becomes case-sensitive if
" it contains any capital letters. This makes searching more convenient.
" Can always use \c and \C at end of the pattern to overide this setting
" temporarily.
